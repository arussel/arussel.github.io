I'm Alexandre Russel, a software engineer transitioning into the blockchain space.

## Background

I've spent years building backend systems, payment infrastructure, and scalable applications. Now I'm applying that experience to decentralized systems — starting with Solana.

## Why Blockchain?

The technical challenges are genuinely interesting: consensus mechanisms, cryptographic guarantees, economic incentive design. But more than that, I believe programmable money and trustless systems will reshape how we build software.

## What I'm Building

I learn by building. Recent projects:

- **[Open Lotto](https://github.com/arussel/open-lotto)** — A decentralized lottery on Solana with verifiable randomness via Switchboard oracles. Rust/Anchor program with a keeper CLI.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking roles where I can contribute to blockchain infrastructure, DeFi protocols, or developer tooling. I'm particularly interested in:

- Solana ecosystem projects
- Protocol development
- Smart contract security
- Infrastructure and tooling
